# This example doesn't use input variables
# All configuration is defined in locals in main.tf
#
# If you want to make this example configurable, you can add variables here
# For example:
#
# variable "environment" {
#   description = "Environment name"
#   type        = string
#   default     = "dev"
# }
#
# variable "aws_region" {
#   description = "AWS region"
#   type        = string
#   default     = "us-east-1"
# }
